MODELS:

User:

    - long          id          (auto)
    - String        username    (input)
    - String        password    (input)
    - ArrayList     UserRoles   (un-needed)
    - ArrayList     sleepData   (un-needed)

    Creating a user(not yet set up) or logging in:

		This part is different because OAuth2 requires a specific format!

		*****
		In your Headers when logging in, you need this authorization property:
		headers: {
            Authorization: "Basic bGFtYmRhLWNsaWVudDpsYW1iZGEtc2VjcmV0"
        }
		(Once you're logged in, this can be set to the auth token)

        The body must be a string formatted like this one:
        `grant_type=password&username=${creds.username}&password=${creds.password}`
        *****

        What the string is as a JS object:
        loginUser = {
            grant_type: "password",
            username: this.state.username,
            password: this.state.password,
            client_id: "lambda-client",
            client_secret: "lambda-secret"
        }
		(Remember, the server will NOT accept JSON. I wish it did, but it requires the format used above)

SleepData:

    - long          id          (auto)
    - User          user        (auto)
    - LocalDateTime sleepdate   (input)
    - LocalDateTime wakedate    (input)
    - int           sleepmood   (input)
    - int           wakemood    (input)
    - int           avgmood     (input)

    Creating a new SleepData:
    newSleepData = {
        sleepdate: [2019, 7, 15, 21, 00]
        wakedate:  [2019, 7, 16,  6, 00] (CANNOT BE AN EMPTY ARRAY!)
        sleepmood: 4 (Best mood)
        wakemood:  2 (Bad-ish mood)
        avgmood:   0 (Mood not defined yet)
    }

*****
LocalDateTime is kinda like an Array:
    [2019, 7, 4, 21, 30] = July 4th, 2019 21:30
    As long as you can pass an array this way, you're good!

ENDPOINTS:

    base URL = "https://sleep-mood-db.herokuapp.com/"

    login = "/login"

    get ALL sleepData, sorted by date (oldest to newest) = "/sleep/all"

    add a new sleepData = "/sleep/new"
